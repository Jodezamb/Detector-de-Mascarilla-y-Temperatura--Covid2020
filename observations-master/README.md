Mask Classifier



Coronavirus has now become the talk of the town,
Like most people in the world right now are suffering badly and everyday thousand's of people are dying because of COVID-19,
Iâ€™m genuinely concerned about them. So, Instead of sitting idle and let negative thoughts grow day by day,I decided to do what I do best 
.In the above project i used webscrapped data with classes people wearing mask and no mask and trained a resent 50. then i used the model to predict on a webcam feed
